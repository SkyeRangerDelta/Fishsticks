  "discussionDenRules": "As you are a part of CC, it is my pleasure to permit you access to this free-fire zone of a room that we call the Discussion Den. Before I can let you post anything in there, I need you to understand that there are some specifics that you need to agree to. I won't ramble on, but this is the gist of it:\n\n- This is a free-fire zone. If you get 'triggered', don't go to Staff. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.\n  - Do not dominate the discussion. We want people to be involved in the discussion so don't shut people out of the discussion for no reason.\n  - Obey staff. I will relieve you from this channel if you don't.\n  - There are ramifications to permitting this channel; one of them is that you don't ignite flaming political discussions...at least all the time.\n  - Following the above, do not troll this channel. This is intended for some of the most serious discussions. **Do not troll this channel, offenses may result in perma-bans.**\n\n  Right, that's it then. If you agree to these, you will be held accountable against them for your actions in the den. React to the emoji below and I'll set you up in the den proper."
