Official CC Discord Bot

This Discord bot has entered a stage of advancement that has surpassed my other bot, LCARS47 by nothing less than leaps and bounds. Use it wisely, and you may have some fun. Most systems within this repository are custom designed for the CCG community and are not meant for multi-platform control.

Subroutine Systems

- Temporary channel spawner/handler
- Music player
- Newcomer join handling
- Vouch system (User based rank promotions)
- Filter systems
- Advertisement-nixer system
- Self-diagnostics
- Passive (fun) commands
- Developer mode
- Admin functions
- Polling system (With duplication check)
- Advanced subroutine control systems

Experimental Features
- Inter-bot playlist (non-web-based)

Code Integrity

Designed primarily from NodeJS JavaScript with a small amount of JSON used for data storage.

Privacy Situation

User IDs are handled in specific command strictly for data processing. Specifically for user permissions checks, data validation, and target locking. User data is processed in a non-storage oriented fashion, not expressly for malicious or even informational data recording.
